### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Go ahead and [install Meltano](https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started/installation/) if you haven't already.

1. Install all plugins

   ```bash
   meltano install
   ```

2. Check that the extractor is working properly

   ```bash
   meltano invoke tap-hookdeck --version
   ```

3. Execute an ELT pipeline

   ```bash
   meltano run tap-hookdeck target-jsonl
   ```
